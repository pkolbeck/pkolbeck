My name is Paul T Kolbeck. 

I am currently a student at the University of Maryland, studying physics and computer science. 

I'm interested in all things science. I've
- worked in a lab investigating Myosin 19 (an actin-based protein motor in the cell) 
- discovered new linkers for the synthesis of Antibody-Drug Conjugates
- analyzed data from an atmospheric LIDAR to determine local CO2 mixing ratios

I always enjoy talking to new people, and am happy to share any experiences I've made.
